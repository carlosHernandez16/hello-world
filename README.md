# Code notes 
Basically you want to make the master the organizer
comment out tabs for where areas of code go 
ex.
#Here goes code for back end
People create a branch 
label the branch something relating to what the edit being made is, specifically the tab
People when are ready merge the branch to the master while others can be working on other branches and merging them separatly
All part of a big abstraction where you may use code you have not created but you can call because someone else did and has it iplemented

# Here goes area 1
Yeo here goes 1

# Here goes area 2


# Here goes area 3
